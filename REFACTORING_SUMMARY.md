# Routes and Controllers Refactoring

## Overview
The backend has been refactored to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern by separating route definitions from business logic. This improves code organization, maintainability, and testability.

## Changes Made

### Controllers Created
All business logic has been extracted from route files into dedicated controller classes:

1. **`src/controllers/authController.js`**
   - User registration, login, logout
   - Token refresh and user profile management
   - Firebase Auth integration

2. **`src/controllers/fileController.js`**
   - File upload to Google Cloud Storage
   - File processing coordination with AI service
   - File status tracking and deletion

3. **`src/controllers/queryController.js`**
   - RAG query submission to AI service
   - Query history and statistics
   - Real-time Socket.IO updates

4. **`src/controllers/analysisController.js`**
   - Analysis saving and retrieval
   - Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
   - Analysis statistics

5. **`src/controllers/analyticsController.js`**
   - Dashboard data aggregation
   - Usage analytics across time ranges
   - System metrics (admin only)

### Routes Simplified
Route files now only handle:
- Route definitions and HTTP method mapping
- Request validation rules
- Middleware application
- Controller method invocation

### Benefits

#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Routes: Handle HTTP routing and middleware
- Controllers: Contain business logic
- Better adherence to single responsibility principle

#### 2. **Improved Testability**
- Controllers can be unit tested independently
- Business logic isolated from Express.js specifics
- Easier to mock dependencies

#### 3. **Better Code Organization**
- Related functionality grouped in controller classes
- Reduced file sizes and complexity
- Clearer project structure

#### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Business logic changes don't affect routing
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced code duplication

#### 5. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new routes without bloating controllers
- Controllers can be further split if needed
- Clear patterns for future development

## Route Patterns

### Before (Route with Business Logic)
```javascript
router.post('/login', validation, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // 50+ lines of business logic
    const result = await complexBusinessLogic();
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
});
```

### After (Route with Controller)
```javascript
const authController = require('../controllers/authController');

router.post('/login', validation, authController.login);
```

## Controller Patterns

Controllers are implemented as classes with singleton instances:

```javascript
class AuthController {
  async login(req, res) {
    // Business logic here
  }
  
  async register(req, res) {
    // Business logic here
  }
}

module.exports = new AuthController();
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Controllers can now be easily unit tested
2. **Add JSDoc**: Document controller methods and parameters
3. **Error Handling**: Consider adding centralized error handling for controllers
4. **Validation**: Move validation logic to dedicated validators if needed
5. **Services Layer**: Extract complex business logic to service classes for further separation

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for scaling the application while maintaining clean, organized, and testable code.
